In this project I worked with a team of 5 people to create a program that could help students with their math themes.

Here, I was repsonsible for the following functions:
- niveldos()
- seleccionDos()
- seleccion()
As well as the creation of the if conditional to display the score of the student (this can be found at the bottom of each level).
